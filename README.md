# Band Catalog

## Goal

Train the access of data (in objects and arrays).

## New Concepts

- [template literals](http://devdocs.io/javascript/template_literals) (multiline string)
- [Array .sort()](http://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/array/sort)
- [fetch()](http://devdocs.io/dom/windoworworkerglobalscope/fetch) (similar to jQuery AJAX)

## Preparation

## Exercise

Create a `index.html`, a `style.css` file and an `index.js`.

### Design

If the viewport size is smaller than __640px__ the "cards" are
arranged on __1 column__.
If the viewport size is bigger than __640px__ the "cards" are
arranged on __2 columns__.
If the viewport size is bigger than 1024px the "cards" are
arranged on __4 columns__.
